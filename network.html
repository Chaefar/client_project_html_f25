            <h2>Networking Tips</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Define Your Networking Goals</strong>
                    Are you exploring career options, seeking an internship, job, research opportunity, or mentorship? Try being specific, such as "Learn about data experience."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Create an Elevator Pitch</strong><!--I tried putting a break (<br>) after each strong closing tag in this section but the W3 Validator kept marking it as an error-->
                    An elevator pitch is a brief introduction of you career interests and goals. It is meant to engage listeners and help start conversations. Do you need help creating
                    an elevator pitch? Here is an <a href = " https://docs.google.com/document/d/1633aBaWXIZW_ImTP-jKKN0QNXK9-RpXXmVznRgA4ZHQ/edit?tab=t.0">Elevator Pitch Checklist</a> to help you get started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Make a Networking Plan</strong>
                    If you don't know where to begin with networking, The CDO has created the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/18HMt79BU8ovGf9z7_P7No5tuwUS6qHNW5u0sgrepLtE/edit?tab=t.0">LAMPS List for Strategic Networking</a> to help you get started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Create Personal and Professional Networks</strong>
                    One of the fastest ways to network is by connecting with people who are in your life already. Connect with friends and peers to create a Personal Network and connect with Mentors and Faculty
                    to create a Professional Network.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Connect By Email</strong>
                    Writing professional emails helps you connect to people of interest, reach out to recruiters, and follow up with professionals. But networking emails require some etiquette.
                    Below we have provided you with a couple of resources to help write proper networking emails:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href = "https://resumeworded.com/networking-email-templates/">Networking Email Templates for 2025</a>
                        <li><a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwq2KtdKQbO-tICHKUyKRA3QY4_3VJ8NLC2kwPBY4dI/edit?tab=t.0">Networking Email Examples</a>
                    </ul>
                    Once you send an email, you may get a response in the next few business days. If you dont receive a response in seven business days after sending your email,
                    it's best to send a follow up email. You can find contact information for organizations at <a href = "https://search.lib.umich.edu/databases/record/9135?query=d%26B+hoovers">D&B Hoovers</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Create a LinkIn Profile</strong>
                    <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> is an online platform made for professional networking. On it you can create a professional profile, write and read posts about
                    you career, receive notifications tailored to career interests, and follow other people and organizations.
