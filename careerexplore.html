                    <p class = "box">
                    <strong>What are your values, interests, and goals?</strong><br>
                    Think about your values and interests as these both factor into what kind of
                    career will help you reach your goals. A value-aligning career will make your career life more fulfilling and meaningful.

                        <strong>What work experience and skill sets do you have?</strong><br>
                    Different career paths will require you to have various experiences and skills. Think about the jobs, internships, class projects,
                    or other work you've done and what you have learned from these. Take time to evaluate what kinds of experience and skills you currently have.

                    You don't need to have everything figured out before pursuing a career path. In fact, people often develop necessary skills and
                    experiences while in their career. Reflecting on areas you want to grow in will help prepare you to proactively take steps to
                    do so. Remember, no matter what or how many experiences or skills you have, there is always room for growth.

                    Based on what you've thought of so far, what are the necessary things you need to do in order to pursue your desired career path?
                    What credentials might you need? Is there any important information you need to know about a career? What personal, social, or financial,
                    areas require extra support?
